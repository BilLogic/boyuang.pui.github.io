Updates!
6A checkpoints:
1.1. Made Lo-fi Prototype for "About Us" page 
    (The pdf file is under this folder with title "Lofi_aboutUs")
    Design choice: I designed this simple page that tells the customers about the story, value, and achievement of the Bun Bun Bakery.
    The goal is to straightforwardly provide useful information that could attract the users. 
    Therefore, under the achievement section, I picked 4 numbers that describes the shop's success and connection with the neighborhood.
    To keep the page simple and clean, I used grids to regulate all sections.
    I decided to de-saturate the colors as high saturations might make them tired.
1.2 Made Hi-fi Prototype for "About Us" page
    (the page could be fold with the Figma link below)
    The hi-fi prototype basically follows the design I come up with in the lo-fi stage.
    In addition, I've included a photo wall which users could interact with and share they own story about rolls/the bakery with others.
    To maintain the consistency in style, I followed the color theme with a cozy tone.

1.3 Made change to Hi-fi Prototype for "Side-bar Cart"
    The idea here is to let the customers pick their time for delivery more easily.

2 brief coding implementations
    2.0 HTML & CSS file for About Us page (both validated)
    2.1 implement smart auto-fill description on Item-description page with JS
    2.2 implement function that keep track of all items added to cart with JS
    2.3 implement function to help display in cart item on the side bar with JS
    2.4 make function described in 3 in both speed order page and product menu page
    2.5 implement function to keep track of total item counts with JS
    2.6 implement function to directly delete item on cart side bar with JS
    2.7 implement function to make in-menu add to cart fully functional with JS
        make sure minor errors won't destroy the system
    2.8 Decrease the saturation of the site with CSS


Future moves:
0. The in-menu add to cart needs to return to itself after clicking on confirm (This is a bug)
0.1 The in-menu selections needs better renderer
1. Today's special page function is still under construction
2. The checkout page is still ugly and needs to be modified
3. The sidebar cart page needs to be modified to have a wishlist implementation
4. Need a final payment & delivery page after the checkout page


Friendly instruction on browsing through the website:
1. Whenever you get stuck in certain page, you can always get back to the homepage by clicking on the Bun Bun Bakery Icon.
2. The detailed description page is implemented. Feel free to check out whichever roll and try add it to cart!
3. On-page add to cart feature is also implemented, to activate, drag the arrow bar to right
4. Portable view cart option is available for both product menu page and speed order page.

Friendly instruction on browsing through the website:
1. Whenever you get stuck in certain page, you can always get back to the homepage by clicking on the Bun Bun Bakery Icon.
2. The detailed description page is only partially implemented. To check that out, you can click on the OG roll picture under the produce menu.
3. The one-click Add to Cart hasn't been implemented yet.
4. Portable view cart option is available for both product menu page and speed order page.

Extra work I've done:
1. Interactive animations:
    - Homepage
    - Rotatable icons and images
2. Optional pages inherited from the Figma Prototype: 
    - Today's Special Page
    - Speed Order Page
    - Check-out Page
3. Some tiny features that could provide users with more freedom: 
    - Portable Cart view on the side
    - Responsive Images that reflect user's selection
    - Responsive buttons that flip its color and background color
4. Pages are reachable from one another with the navigation bar
5. Pages, images, and fonts are mostly adjustable to screen size
